# Providers

Data Providers give easy access to various data storage systems using a consistent, predictable set of methods. 

These methods, unfortunately are still being determined, but we got a real nice example going on in the [komada-pieces repository](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada-pieces/blob/master/providers/localStorage.js)!
