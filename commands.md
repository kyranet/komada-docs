#Komada Pieces: Commands

`Commands` are how your bot interacts with users: a user enters a command, the bot runs that command and responds according to the code written inside of the command file.

## Existing Core Commands

There are some core commands that are shipped with Komada. Currently, these are: `conf`, `disable`, `download`, `enable`, `eval`, `help`, `info`, `invite`, `ping`, `reboot`, `reload`, `stats` and `transfer`.

## User-Submitted Commands

The [komada-pieces repository](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada-pieces/tree/master/commands) contains some user-submitted commands that you can easily import into your bot using the [download command](download-pieces.md), or copy over to your bot manually.
